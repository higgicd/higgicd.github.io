    "text": "Project Summary\nOver the past several decades, policies that promote higher density, mixed use, compact, and transit-oriented development have been implemented as a means of achieving urban vitality and more sustainable growth around the world. Previous research into property markets and individual and household preferences has demonstrated that there is demand amongst certain segments of the population for living in neighbourhoods that offer rapid transit accessibility and higher-density built environments rich in urban amenities.\nHowever, the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant shock to the urban systems of many cities, including those in Canada. Early evidence suggests that social distancing measures and increases in remote work have contributed to plummeting transit ridership and a shift in locational preferences for more suburban development. While it remains unclear how transportation systems and housing markets will adjust as we emerge from the pandemic, its disruptive effects on the urban spatial structure of cities requires further investigation.\nFrom a research perspective, previous work examining how individuals and households value transit accessibility and transit-oriented development in housing markets has been conducted under the assumption that individual or household preferences remain (relatively) static and that there will be demand for the benefits of planning interventions that promote more sustainable forms of development. But what happens in the opposite scenario, where transportation services and urban form remain constant and preferences rapidly change? To answer this question, the proposed research seeks to analyze the relationship between property market indicators, household locational preferences and travel patterns, and the demand for urban and suburban built environments."

    "text": "King Street Transit Priority Corridor\nThe Transit Priority corridor launched as a pilot project on November 12, 2017, with the primary objective of improving transit service along a 2.6km stretch of King Street between Bathurst and Jarvis Streets in downtown Toronto (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: King Street Pilot Corridor\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of the City of Toronto\nTransit priority was achieved by restricting through-movements and left turns for private vehicles, removing on-street parking, and giving priority transit vehicles (Figure 3). Streetscape improvements such as seating, patios, public art, bicycle parking, and parkettes made the corridor more pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sample Urban Design Plan for the King Street Pilot Corridor Project\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of the City of Toronto\nAs a pilot project, the City of Toronto collected a wealth of data related to transit vehicle performance, traffic, pedestrian and cyclist volumes, business performance, and stakeholder feedback along the corridor and posted regular updates through a project dashboard. One of these datasets is streetcar travel times collected using the TTC’s Communication and Information System (CIS) that tracks transit vehicle movements throughout the city.\nWith regards to primary objective of increasing travel speeds and the reliability of streetcar services along the corridor, previous analyses conducted by the City and others (e.g. 1; 2) have examined CIS and GPS data and concluded that the implementation of the priority corridor generally resulted in decreases in travel times and improvements to service reliability. We will follow their lead to calculate the change in travel times across the pre-pilot and pilot period phases from the CIS data."
